# About the project

This project is design to get Googlers connect in a fun and exciting way by using Google Search Trends.
The project will work along similar ideas to virtual trading platforms, but instead of investing in stocks, the player can invest “Trend Bucks” in a Google search query. By buying into a search at a given point in time, they can cash out later and earn or lose “Trend Bucks" based on increased or decreased global interest in that query, as indicated by Google trends data. This provides an interactive way for teams to compete with one another to predict search trends overtime.

# How to play the game

1. Everyone in this game will be in a competition that is created by an organiser. User can be in more than one competition.
2. The aim of the game is to invest in the Google Search that you think is going to be trending and end up with the most trend bucks at the end of the competition.
3. My sGonks page is where the user can find their current information.
   - Their current trends buck and initial worth.
   - Their search query stocks that they brought with current value and invested value.
   - The graph displaying the search trends of their stocks.
4. Users can invest in the Google search query at the sGonks Market page.
   - User will be able to search up the search query they want to invest in and see a graph displaying how much it's worth through out the year.
   - If they decide to purchase this search qurey they can put in the about they want to invest in and purchase it.
5. The competition page is where the user can see their ranking in their team. This page will diplays the competitions details and current rank of everyone in that competition.

# Setup

# Instructions about React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
